    def _read_prompt(self, agent_name, placeholders=None):
        """
        Reads the prompt file for a given agent, checking for custom or default files.

        The method searches for prompt files within the `prompts` directory. 
        It first looks for a custom prompt file and falls back to a default prompt 
        if the custom file does not exist.

        **Prompt Directory Location**:
        - The base prompt directory is named `prompts`. If the strategy has a 
        `strategy_type`, the prompt files are located in a subdirectory named 
        after that strategy (e.g., `prompts/strategy_name`).

        **Prompt File Naming**:
        - Custom prompt file: `{agent_name}.custom.txt`
        - Default prompt file: `{agent_name}.txt`

        **Prompt Lookup**:
        - If `{agent_name}.custom.txt` exists, it is read.
        - If not, `{agent_name}.txt` is read.
        - If neither file exists, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

        **Placeholder Replacement**:
        - If `placeholders` are provided, any placeholder in the prompt following 
        the format `{{placeholder_name}}` will be replaced with the corresponding 
        value from `placeholders`.
        - For any remaining placeholders not replaced (i.e., not in `placeholders`), 
        the method will search for a file named `placeholder_name.txt` in the 
        `prompts/common` directory. If the file exists, the placeholder will be replaced 
        with the content of that file.

        **Examples**:
        For an agent named `agent1` and a strategy type `customer_service`, the 
        following files are searched:
        1. `prompts/customer_service/agent1.custom.txt`
        2. `prompts/customer_service/agent1.txt`
        
        Parameters:
        - agent_name (str): The name of the agent for which the prompt is being read.
        - placeholders (dict, optional): A dictionary of placeholder names and 
        their corresponding values to replace in the prompt.

        Returns:
        - str: The content of the prompt file with placeholders replaced if applicable.

        Raises:
        - FileNotFoundError: If neither a custom nor a default prompt file is found.
